# Object-oriented-System-Design

Assignments to Stanford University Course - Object-oriented System Design CS108

Course Description:
There are many benefits of object-oriented programming (OOP) including faster development, reusability, and decreased maintenance costs. OOP ties a set of data to a set of behaviors and provides a greater sense of context for data.

This course is designed to strengthen a student's programming ability through several large and interesting programming projects. Students will be taught how to find information on their own and find solutions using available documentation to encourage programming confidence in industry. The course covers object-oriented principles and provides a broad exposure to programming areas such as multi-threaded programs, communication between processes and interacting with databases. Students should expect a project component within this course.
